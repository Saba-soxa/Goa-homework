BMW is an abbreviation for Bayerische Motoren Werke. This name is grammatically incorrect (in German, compound words must not contain spaces), which is why the grammatically correct form of the name, Bayerische Motorenwerke (German pronunciation: baʁʃə motoˌvɛʁkə]  has been used in several publications and advertisements in the past.[24][25] Bayerische Motorenwerke translates into English as Bavarian Motor Works.[26] The suffix AG, short for Aktiengesellschaft, signifies an incorporated entity owned by shareholders, thus akin to "Inc." (US) or PLC, "Public Limited Company" (UK).

 The terms Beemer, Bimmer and Bee-em are sometimes used as slang for BMW in the English language[27][28] and are sometimes used interchangeably for cars and motorcycles
